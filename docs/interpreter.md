# üß† Interpreter Architecture (Implementation Overview)

This document describes the structure and implementation of the NetLang interpreter.

---

## üßæ Overview

The NetLang interpreter is implemented in **Python** and designed as a **two-pass execution engine** using the ANTLR4 parser generator.

### üîÅ Two-pass design:
1. **TypeCheckingVisitor** ‚Äì validates variable declarations, type safety, expressions, and function calls.
2. **Interpreter** ‚Äì executes the code after type checking has passed successfully.

Both visitors implement traversal over the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) produced from the grammar defined in [`NetLang.g4`](../NetLang.g4).

## Scope and Activation Record System in NetLang

In the NetLang interpreter, the scoping system and activation records are implemented using several key classes. The following UML diagrams illustrate the most important data structures used to manage variable/function scopes and function call stack tracking.

---

### `Variable` Class

![Variable](assets/variable.png)

Represents a variable in the current scope.

- `type`: The declared type of the variable (e.g., `"int"`).
- `line_declared`: The line number where this variable was declared, used for error messages.
- `value`: The current runtime value of the variable (interpreter only).

---

### `Function` Class

![Function](assets/function.png)

Represents a user-defined function.

- `parameters`: A list of parameter names and their types.
- `return_type`: The declared return type, or `None` for void.
- `line_declared`: The line where the function is defined.
- `body_ctx`: The ANTLR context (parse tree node) for the function body.

---

### `Scope` Class

![Scope](assets/scope.png)

Represents a single scope frame. Each scope knows its parent.

- `variables`: Dictionary mapping variable names to `Variable` objects.
- `functions`: Dictionary mapping function names to `Function` objects.
- `parent`: Reference to the parent scope (or `None` if this is the global scope).

---

### `ScopedVisitorBase` and Call Stack

![ScopedVisitorBase](assets/scoped_visitor_base.png)

A base class used by both the type checker and interpreter. It manages:

- `scopes`: A list of currently active `Scope` objects (acting like a stack).
- `call_stack`: A list of tuples `(function_name, scope)` used to track dynamic call relationships.

This system allows us to model:
- Dynamic function calls (including recursion),
- Scoped variables with proper resolution using the `parent` chain,
- Nested scopes via blocks (`{}`), loops, and functions.

---

_The next section describes how these components work together to simulate a stack-based execution model with lexical scoping and dynamic activation frames._

---

## Scope Stack and Activation Records

In NetLang, scopes are implemented through a stack-like structure and managed using the `ScopedVisitorBase` class. Each `Scope` object contains a dictionary of `variables` and `functions`, along with a reference to its `parent` scope.

### Scope Push and Pop

The interpreter uses `push_scope()` and `pop_scope()` to control scope activation:

```python
def push_scope(self):
    new_scope = Scope(parent=self.scopes[-1])
    self.scopes.append(new_scope)

def pop_scope(self):
    self.scopes.pop()
```

When a new scope is created, it is appended to the `self.scopes` list and initially inherits the previous scope as its parent. Depending on the context (e.g., function calls), the parent reference might be updated immediately after creation.  A new scope can be created with curly braces: { ... }, if block body, loop body or function body.

### Function Call Handling and Recursion

Function calls may either use the current dynamic scope or a statically captured one. To distinguish between recursive and non-recursive calls, we use:

```python
is_recursive = self.call_stack and self.call_stack[-1][0] is function
parent_scope = self.call_stack[-1][1].parent if is_recursive else self.scopes[-1]
```

- If the current function is recursive, the parent is not the most recent scope but the original parent used in the first invocation (stored on the call stack).
- The new scope is pushed and updated as follows:

```python
self.push_scope()
self.scopes[-1].parent = parent_scope
```

Next, we declare the function parameters insdie that scope. Then, an entry is added to the call stack and the function body is executed:
```python
self.call_stack.append((function, self.scopes[-1]))
self.visit(function.body_ctx)
```

After executing the body, we remove the corresponding scope and call stack entry:
```python
self.pop_scope()
self.call_stack.pop()
```

### Scoped Identifier Resolution

To resolve scoped identifiers like `^x` or `~x`, we recursively walk through the parent scopes:

```python
if prefix.startswith("^"):
    levels_up = len(prefix)
    for _ in range(levels_up):
        scope = scope.parent
elif prefix == "~":
    while scope.parent is not None:
        scope = scope.parent
```

After resolving the reference point, the interpreter searches for a matching variable or function in that scope chain:

```python
while s:
    if var_name in s.variables or var_name in s.functions:
        return s, var_name
    s = s.parent
```

This mechanism ensures correct visibility and isolation of variables depending on their declaration scope and how the function was invoked (static vs dynamic context).

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `main.py`
Entry point script for launching the interpreter from the command line:
```bash
python3 main.py program.netlang
```
This script initializes the ANTLR parser, runs type checking, and executes the program using the interpreter.

## üß™ Interpreter Flow Summary

1. The program is parsed using ANTLR (`NetLang.g4`) into a syntax tree.
2. `TypeCheckingVisitor` validates the entire AST.
3. If type checking passes, `Interpreter` executes the AST.
4. Visualization and packet forwarding is rendered using PyGame and NetworkX.
